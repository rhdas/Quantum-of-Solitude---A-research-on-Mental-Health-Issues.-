Quantum of Solitude - A research on Mental Health Issues.     We often come across people who suffer from Mental Health Issues or we become that person who cant cope-up with the overwhelming emotions attached with other people and our work specifically. Working rigorously has a toll on everyone's mind and no one can escape the pressure.     But can we stop for a second and ask ourselves, what quantum of solitude are we facing which compromises our mental health. Taking care of our Mental Health is as important as physical health.    Note: The Data is a part of 2017 Survey conducted by Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI). I have tried to recreate the dashboard based on the data.
